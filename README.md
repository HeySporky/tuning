### EcuFlash
These tables and methods require EcuFlash (http://www.tactrix.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=36&Itemid=58).

Get your proper base XML:

    Base files can be located in the base_maps directory. These are the same maps that are located on GoldenEvo's site (http://goldenevo.com/). I am simply putting them into github in order to track revision history.

Install the XML into the EcuFlash directory:

    This is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenECU\EcuFlash\rommetadata\mitsubishi\evo or C:\Program Files\OpenECU\EcuFlash\rommetadata\mitsubishi\evo for 64-bit and 32-bit OSes respectively.
